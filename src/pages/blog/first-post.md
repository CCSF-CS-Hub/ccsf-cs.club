Hey Chat! Im excited to announce our club's blog - a place for club members to share cool problems and learning moments. From going to events to solving cool problems, come to see the many faces of the CS Club community.

## Our Content Categories

### Field Notes
In Field Notes, you can read the lessons members learned "in the field" - this could be from hackathons, industry events, or competitions. They aren't just recaps; they are stories about personal growth.

**Example Topic:** "Scoping Work for Quick Collaboration: A Lesson from SCC Hacks" - Learn about product management from Moof's perspective, leading a team at SCC Hacks.

### Build Logs
In build logs, join our members as they explore interesting technical solutions. See how academic topics fit into real world problems.

**Example Topic:** "Using Directed Graphs for Task Planning" - Ivan breaks down how theoretical graph concepts solved a practical project management challenge.

### Speaker Spotlight
Speaker Spotlight posts will have insights and takeaways from our guest speaker series, preserving and sharing their knowledge with people who maybe couldn't make it that day, or with students who will join us in the future.

**Example Topic:** "Designing Distributed Systems: Notes from Gary Ow's Talk" - Learn about common architectures, and how they factor into product management and organizational design.
